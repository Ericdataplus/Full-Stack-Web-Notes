[[tailwind cheat sheets]]

Tailwind is a recent CSS library/ framewok that bundles classes together into short name formats to get use to and you write it righ in the html tag per tag.

For me personally I think Tailwind makes CSS more fun and by using Tailwind itself I learn more about vanilla CSS.

Tailwind is an abstraction (more of a new way) of CSS but there's another step forward with [[daisy ui]], both are great and when you import [[daisy ui]] you autamatically get all of tailwind included with the already made easy [[daisy ui]] classes.
